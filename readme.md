Story: Board Game Directory
===========================

A few months ago, your best friend organized a weekly board game night. As the number of participants
has grown, so has the library of available games. Your friend has asked you to create a website to
track which games are available, as well as all the times they have been played. Your goal is to
create a good-looking prototype that you won't be embarrassed to show your friend, not a fully-finished
product.

Requirements
============

* Ability to add and edit a board game record
* Ability to add multiple game session records associated with a game
* Main screen should include a listing of available games, including the date of the most recent game session for each

Technical Detail
================

The project has already been started for you. Out of the many, many alternatives, these are the tools we've chosen for this challenge:

* <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">node.js</a>
* <a href="https://expressjs.com/">express - web server</a>
* <a href="https://ejs.co/">EJS - templating</a>
* <a href="https://mariadb.org/">MariaDB - database backend</a>

Not required
============

* User account management
* Reactivity

Evaluation
==========

* We will run your solution in a Centos virtual machine to evaluate it, but you should be able to develop on Windows, Mac, or Linux.
* We have not defined the database schema for you. You should decide which fields would be useful to collect and what the table structure should be and put the statements necessary for that in schema.sql.
* Include sample data in your schema.sql file so that we can see what your app looks like fully populated from the start.
* If you see any "TODO" comments in code, those are for you!

Bonus
=====

For extra points, think of a useful feature to add to the system that your friend didn't mention.
